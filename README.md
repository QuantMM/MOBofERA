About ERA
----------

Extended redundancy analysis (ERA) is a statistical method that relates multiple sets of predictors to response variables. In ERA, a component is extracted from each set of predictor variables in such a way that it accounts for the maximum variation of a response variable. In this regard, ERA aims to perform data reduction and linear regression simultaneously, providing a simpler description of directional relationships among many sets of variables.
